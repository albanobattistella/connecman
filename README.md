# ConnecMan

A puzzle game about connecting pieces with straight lines.

This is a remake from the original game (developed with Microsoft's XNA, and because of that it's not currently working in most cases). It's now built in Ruby with [MiniGL](https://github.com/victords/minigl) and runs on Linux and Windows.
