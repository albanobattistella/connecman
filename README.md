# ConnecMan

A puzzle game about connecting pieces with straight lines.

This is a remake from the original game (developed with Microsoft's XNA, and because of that it's not currently working in most cases), you can download it [here](http://alevagames.com/old-projects.html), although it's likely that the installer won't work... I'll remake it with [MiniGL](https://github.com/victords/minigl) and make it available for Linux and Windows.
